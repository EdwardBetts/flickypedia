"""
A page where a user is shown a list of photos with checkboxes, and
they can choose which of them to upload to Wiki Commons.

    - [ ] image 1
    - [ ] image 2
    - [ ] image 3

This page gets a single argument as input: a ``flickr_url`` query parameter
with the URL of the Flickr page provided by the user.

-   If we can find photos at that URL, we render them on the page for
    the user
-   If we can't find photos at that URL, we send the user back to the
    "enter a URL" page with an appropriate error message

To ensure a stable experience over reloads/further steps, we save the
initial API response from the Flickr API.  We can then retrieve this
later in the session.

TODO:

*   Add filtering by license type to this page
*   Limit the number of options you can submit
*   Detect duplicates at this stage
